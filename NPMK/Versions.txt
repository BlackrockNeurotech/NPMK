    NEW FUNCTIONS
	- NSxToHL: Strips the header information from a NSx file and saves it 
      into a new .dat file. This is useful for programs that only need the
      binary data, e.g. Klusters.
	- openNSxHL: Opens the header-less data into a variable.
	  This is useful for programs that only need the binary data, 
      e.g. Klusters.

      signal.
